Some of the examples use explicitly pseudopotential files contained in the
../../fixtures/sample_psf folder.

Other examples set up automatically the pseudopotential dictionary by searching for
the appropriate PsfData nodes in a "pseudopotential family", named 'sample_psf_family'.
Before they can be run, the family's .psf files have to be uploaded to the database by executing:

  aiida-pseudo install family /path-to-examples/fixtures/sample_psf psf_family

The lua examples require the set of the `lua_elements_path` variable inside
the script.
