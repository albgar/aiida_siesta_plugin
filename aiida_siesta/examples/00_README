Some of the examples use explicitly pseudopotential files contained in the fixtures/sample_psf folder.

Other examples set up automatically the pseudopotential dictionary by searching for the appropriate 
PsfData nodes in a "pseudopotential family", named 'psf_family'.
Before they can be run, the family must be created with the command:

  aiida-pseudo install family /path-to-examples/fixtures/sample_psf psf_family -P pseudo.psf

The lua examples require the set of the `lua_elements_path` variable inside the script.

To run the examples, follow the instructions in the 00_READMEs of the plugins and workflows
folders.
